    <h2>Why We Indent Code</h2>
    <p>
      It's simple: organization! Indenting our code helps keep our code organized. Poorly-indented code is hard to read 
      and can often lead to errors. By making sure your code is indented, you're making your life as a web developer much easier!

    <h2>Whitespace in HTML</h2>
    <p>
      Notice that even though         this code is indented, HTML is ignoring the extra whitespace. The only whitespace that 
      HTML cares about is a single space (usually in betwee characters).
