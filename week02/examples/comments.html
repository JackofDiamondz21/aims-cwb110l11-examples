  <h1>HTML Comments</h1>

  <p>HTML comments are there to help a developer remember certain aspects of their code.</p>

  <p>
    For example, if I wasn't sure why a break tag was a self-closing tag, I could refer to my comments to 
    remember why.
  </p>

  <!-- <p> Furthermore, comments can be useful if we want to temporarily remove code. Notice that this doesn't display on the page.</p> -->

  <p>Comments start with a opening bracket, an exclamation mark, and two dashes. A comment will wrap <!-- multiple
  
  lines 
  of --> code until you "close the comment" (two dashes and a closing bracket).</p>
