<h1>Whitespace</h1>

<p>As you've probably noticed, whitespace           is ignored in a lot of ways
  
  
  
  
  
  by the browser. That being said, this text will be printed as a only one or two lines (depending your browser's width) with no 
  extra spaces and no newlines.</p>

<p>As a general practice, whitespace is ignored by the browser <em>except</em> for a single space (between words, for example).</p>

<h2>Pre Tags</h2>
<p>There are SOME tags that preserve whitespace in visual browsers. The pre tag below is a good example of preserved whitespace.</p>

<pre>
  Now all of my whitespace          between characters


  is preserved. Enter keys, extra     spaces, and             tabs are no longer ignored.

           Nevertheless, you should NOT use pre tags to format text this way. Try resizing your browser to see why.
