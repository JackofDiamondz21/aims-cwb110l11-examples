  <h1>Opening and Closing Tags</h1>
  <p>In HTML, every opening tag has an associated closing tag. A paired opening and closing tag is called an HTML element</p>

  <p>The only difference between an opening tag and a closing tag is that content an opening tag doesn't have the slash (/).</p>

  <p>In this case, this text is sitting within a paragraph element. The element name, in this case, is "p". Thus, we'd call the opening and closing 
    tags of this paragraph "p tags".</p>
