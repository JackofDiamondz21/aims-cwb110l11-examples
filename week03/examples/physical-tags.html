<h1>Physical Tags</h1>

<p>Physical tags are used to control how text and other content should be presented in a browser. Physical tags are used sparingly in modern web
  development, but they're good to have in your back pocket. Many physical tags are only for visual web browsers.</p>

<h2>Font Tag</h2>
<p>The most recognizeable physical tag is the font tag. You can use the font tag to control many aspects of the presentation of text.</p>
<p><font color="red">This text is colored red.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">This text uses a size 3 font.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This text has the Arial font face.</font></p>

<h2>Underline, Italics, Bold, and Strikethrough Tags</h2>
<p>You can also <u>underline</u>, <i>italicize</i>, <b>bold</b>, and <s>strike through</s> your text with physical formatting tags.</p>

<h2>Break Tag</h2>
<p>The break tag is one of the few physical tags that you'll still see often in modern HTML development.<br />They are used to break up
  sections of text into a new lines. As you can see here, we only have one paragraph of text broken up.</p>

<h2>Superscript and Subscript</h2>
<p>The <sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub> tags are other good uses of physical formatting tags, though many non-visual browsers
  make use of them as logical tags as well.</p>
